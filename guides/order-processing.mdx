  </Step>
</Steps>

</Note>

## Pick, Pack, and Ship

### Picking Orders

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Picking">
    Navigate to "Orders" → "Picking" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Pick List">
    Select orders to pick or use filters to create batch picks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Print Pick List">
    Generate a picking document with optimized routes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather Items">
    Collect items from their warehouse locations.

    Scan items or manually update picking status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

<Tip>
  Wave picking (picking multiple orders at once by location) can save significant time! It's like a duck collecting multiple pieces of bread in one dive.
</Tip>

### Packing Orders

Once items are picked, it's time to package them:

1. Go to "Orders" → "Packing" tab
2. Select an order to pack
3. Verify all items are present
4. Scan each item as you place it in the package
5. Add packing materials as needed
6. Enter package dimensions and weight
7. Mark the order as packed

<Warning>
  Always double-check that you've included all items before sealing packages! A duck would never leave one of her ducklings behind, and you shouldn't leave any items behind either!
</Warning>

  <Step title="Go to Shipping">
    Navigate to "Orders" → "Shipping" tab.
  </Step>

## Managing Order Issues

### Order Modifications

Need to make changes to an existing order?

1. Find the order in the list
2. Click "Edit Order"
3. Make necessary changes to items, quantities, addresses, etc.
4. Save changes

<Note>
  You can only modify orders that haven't been shipped yet! Once the duck has flown the pond, you can't change its flight path.
</Note>

### Order Cancellations

To cancel an order:

1. Find the order in the list
2. Click the "Actions" dropdown
3. Select "Cancel Order"

</Steps>

<Tip>
  Set up a dedicated return inspection area in your warehouse - like a duck's quarantine pond for checking returning ducklings!
</Tip>

## Order Analytics

- **Fulfillment Time**: Measure how long it takes to process orders
- **Popular Items**: See which products are ordered most frequently
- **Customer Insights**: View ordering patterns by customer
- **Returns Analysis**: Understand why items are being returned

<Warning>
  Past performance is not always indicative of future results. Even ducks can change their migration patterns if conditions change!
