For example, `A3-B2` means:
- Zone A
- Aisle 3
- Shelf B
- Bin 2

<Tip>
  Think of your warehouse like a duck pond - zones are like different sections of the pond, aisles are like swimming lanes, shelves are like perches, and bins are like nests!

## Inventory Counting Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cycle Counting">
    Instead of counting all inventory at once (like trying to count all ducks in the pond at the same time), cycle counting allows you to count a portion of your inventory on a rotating schedule.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ABC Classification">
    Classify your inventory into A (high value), B (medium value), and C (low value) items. Count A items more frequently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bin Reconciliation">
    When counts don't match expected quantities, DuckTape WMS makes it easy to investigate and reconcile the differences.
