This key returns mock data instead of real data from your account - perfect for testing the waters before diving in!

<Note>
  If you're feeling down, just remember: Ducks float because they have waterproof feathers. Your API requests float through our system because they have waterproof API keys!

## API Key Management

### Regenerating Keys

If you need to regenerate your API key (maybe it got leaked, or maybe a fox got to it), follow these steps:

1. Go to **Integration Hub** → **API Access**
2. Click **Regenerate API Key**
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Regenerating your API key will invalidate your old key immediately. Make sure to update any systems using the old key!
</Warning>

### Deleting Keys

If you no longer need an API key:

1. Go to **Integration Hub** → **API Access**
2. Click **Delete API Key**
3. Confirm the action

Remember: A duck without a bill can't quack, and an app without an API key can't access our API!
