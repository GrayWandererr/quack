# Authentication

All API requests to DuckTape WMS require authentication via API keys. Think of them as the secret duck call that lets you access our system.

## API Keys

Your API key should be included in the header of all API requests:

```bash
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys as secure as a duck's nest! Don't share them publicly or commit them to GitHub.
</Warning>

## Getting an API Key

You can generate an API key from the DuckTape WMS dashboard:

1. Navigate to the **Integration Hub** page
2. Click on **API Access**
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy your key (you won't be able to see it again!)
